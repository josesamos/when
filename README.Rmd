The *When* dimension plays a fundamental role in *Multidimensional Systems*, it allows us to express **when** the analysed focus of attention have occurred.

The purpose of the `when` package is to assist in the implementation of the *When* dimension in multidimensional systems. In particular, it supports the generation of tables for the implementation of **date** and **time** in ROLAP (*Relational On-Line Analytical Processing*) systems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `when` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("josesamos/when")
```

## Example

To obtain a table with dates we indicate the start date and the end date. We can select the level of detail, the attributes to include or the language of the literals for day and month names. In the following example we only indicate the language because it is different from the one we have in the computer's operating system.

```{r example}
library(when)

date <-
  when(
    locale = Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "English"),
    start = lubridate::today(),
    end = lubridate::today() + 9
  ) |>
  generate_table() |>
  get_table()
```

The result obtained is shown below.

```{r, results = "asis"}
pander::pandoc.table(date, split.table = Inf)
```

If we want a table with time, we indicate the type using a parameter. By default we get all the seconds of a day but we can also configure a different period or level of detail.

```{r}
time <-
  when(type = 'time') |>
  generate_table() |>
  get_table()
```

The start and end of the result table is shown below.

```{r, results = "asis"}
pander::pandoc.table(rbind(head(time, 5), tail(time, 5)),
                     split.table = Inf)
```

In addition to obtaining them as `tibble`, we can export the tables to files in *csv* or *xlsx* format. They can also be exported directly to any Relational DBMS.
