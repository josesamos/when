\description{
When the dimension is defined as a date type, using this function we can select
the day level and its attributes to include in it: date, month_day, week_day,
quarter_day and year_day.
}
\details{
The \code{include_all} and \code{exclude_all} parameters allow us to include or exclude
all attributes, and then specifically exclude or include the ones we need.

For the week_day we have the day number, its name and the name abbreviation.
So that the order of the names corresponds to the alphabetical order, the
combination of day number and name and/or abbreviation is included.

\examples{

td <- when() |>
  select_day_level(day_abbr = FALSE,
                    day_num_abbr = FALSE)
